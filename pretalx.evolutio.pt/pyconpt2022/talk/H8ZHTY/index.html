        <meta name="description" content="How can we solve sustainability problems through data?

AI, Data Science, and Analytics brought immense advantages to many businesses. However, there seems to be a gap concerning sustainability, in which decision-making is not yet benefitting as much as it could from these technologies.

This talk takes a deep dive into this topic and how Python can help us bridge the gap by being a one-stop shop for all kinds of tools required to approach these problems. We propose a simple 4-step data science methodology: Geospatial Indexing, Feature Engineering, Predictive Scoring, and Score Optimization.

We will dive into the specificities of each one of these steps and go through their requirements, dependencies and applications. Afterward, we will move to the deployment of solutions and how they translate into tangible impact on several issues with four case studies. 

This methodology has been successfully used in different Data Science competitions, including the winning solution for the World Data League, which gathers the best data scientists to solve social impact challenges.">

With extensive experience in business, strategy, and engineering case study competitions, as well as in data science hackathons, both nationally and internationally. <br>
I've been active in several juvenile associations, most prominently, as President of ShARE-UP, a junior association that develops a training program for students and consulting projects for startups and businesses, focusing on combining economic performance with societal progress.<br>
Professionally, I've worked at <a href="http://smartex.ai/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Smartex.ai</a>, a fast-growing Portuguese start-up that is disrupting the textile industry by providing AI tools to minimize waste production, and its environmental consequences. Besides, I've used analytical and machine learning tools in a brief internship at Sonae Fashion, as part of the Customer Strategy team.<br>
Currently looking for ways to apply business, analytical and technical concepts to solve social or environmental issues.</p></div>
