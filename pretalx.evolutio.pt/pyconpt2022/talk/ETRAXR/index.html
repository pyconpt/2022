        <meta name="title" content="How to become a FastAPI Expert  - PyCon Portugal 2022 pretalx">
        <meta name="description" content="FastAPI is a relatively new web framework that has been growing a lot lately. We&#x27;ll go through the features, and things that make the framework great, and understand why its popularity has been growing so fast.

We&#x27;ll go through the history of the framework, and understand why it was created.
What was missing in the world that made FastAPI not only a new web framework, but the missing piece in the Python World.

Furthermore, we&#x27;ll see how I went from a newbie to a FastAPI expert, and how you can become one as well.
No matter how much experience you are, this talk will still be useful to you if you&#x27;re interested in helping our community.
