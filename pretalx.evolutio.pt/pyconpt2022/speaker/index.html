As a Biomedical Engineering to-be, I want to bring AI and clinical data together to improve healthcare and people’s quality of life. Driven by delivering a good impact with my analytical and technical skills, I am also interested in solving sustainability and societal issues. I was President of ShARE-UP, a Do Well Do Good international consulting club that promotes social progress. More recently, alongside my teammates, I won a couple of datathons with challenges that tackled some of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals.</p></div>
