This is a guide for the organisers and volunteers of DjangoCon Europe on handling [Code of Conduct](/conduct/code_of_conduct/) (CoC) reports. This guide is mostly aimed at conference staff to help us deal with incidents professionally, and reduce the risk of mistakes. This is especially important because conferences are stressful and involve significant time pressure. However, it's always possible that special circumstances require a deviation from this guide.

Some parts of this guide discuss very severe incidents, like ongoing violence. This is not because these events are common at DjangoCon, but rather because we want to be prepared as well as reasonably possible, for anything from the more common smaller incidents to the most severe cases.
