DjangoCon Europe has a dedicated Code of Conduct Active Response Ensurers (CARE) team, and this team will generally handle any reports. However, other organisers and volunteers are sometimes the first point of contact, or may observe incidents themselves.

In general, as a representative of the conference, be aware that other participants look toward you for appropriate behaviour within the Code of Conduct.

When you are an organiser or volunteer not on the CARE team, the general guidelines for observing an incident or receiving a report are:

- If you can easily find a member of the CARE team, do that, and let them handle the incident from there on. In that case, you don’t need to do anything else. If you were a witness, the CARE team may ask for more information later.
- If you can't easily find a CARE team member, write down the basic details of the incident: what happened, who was involved, when and where this happened, whether the incident is ongoing and how we can contact the reporter. If someone is reluctant to provide some of this information, or doesn’t know, do not pressure them.
- If possible, the reporter can also send a mail to [conduct@djangocon.eu](mailto:conduct@djangocon.eu). This is helpful, as it gives the CARE team a first-hand written account.
- In any case, pass the details you noted down to a CARE team member as soon as possible.
- If requested, try to arrange for an escort by staff or a trusted person, help the reporter contact a friend, or contact local law enforcement. Never pressure any of these action if the reporter does not want this.
- Do not share any of the information with anyone else.

In speaking to a reporter, be cautious in your wording. Try to be understanding and compassionate, and make them feel heard and taken seriously. However, do not make commitments on whether the conference will see this as a violation, or what action will be taken.

In urgent cases, where it is not possible to contact a CARE team member and you believe immediate action is essential, you may intervene unilaterally. For example, you may consider this:

- When any delay of action will likely bring unacceptable further harm to others. Ongoing aggression or serious harassment are examples of this.
- If you feel people are in immediate physical danger, it can be appropriate to contact local law enforcement.
- If you witness a presentation which is clearly in violation of the Code of Conduct repeatedly or very seriously. You might simply say “I’m sorry, this presentation cannot be continued at the present time”. Examples of when this is justified could be significant threats of violence, harassment of others, or continuous sexist jokes. Do not end a presentation in cases like a few inappropriate jokes - in that case do report it to the CARE team.

When possible, even in these cases, consult with another organiser or volunteer if you see one nearby.
