Last year, we postponed several contracts which included several down-payments for the venue, audio & video teams, stage preparation, among others. These expenses are now considered lost and therefore the organisation is currently under water. We are trying to be as clear as possible with the Django community, and due to this "physical-event" related expenses we will not be able to offer a free conference as in last year. 

We are now asking for your much needed support to help cover the loss of these postponed contracts and the expenses related to the virtual event. If you are from a marginalised or under-represented group, and you are not able to afford a ticket, you should apply for a [grant](/information/grants/). **Please consider making an extra donation** to help us offer grants to people from marginalised or under-represented groups and cover the lost expenses from last year.

**All tickets include access to all 3 conference days (June 2 - 4) and the 2 sprints days (June 5 - 6)**. Don't forget to follow us on Twitter [@DjangoConEurope](https://twitter.com/djangoconeurope){:target="_blank"} for the latest up to date information!

The following **ticket types** are available:

- **Student Ticket (€69)** - If you are currently enrolled as a full-time student or if you are currently without regular income. This ticket does not cover our costs for the conference, but we’ll be able to provide it to you thanks to other people paying more for their ticket than the minimal price.s
- **Individual Ticket (€119)** - If you are paying your ticket from your personal money and are not being reimbursed by your employer.
- **Business Ticket (€179)** - If your employer is paying for the ticket or reimbursing you for your conference expenses.
- **CONTRIBUTOR Ticket (€299)** - The additional money from this ticket type ensure we can afford offering cheaper tickets to students and other people who could not afford to join otherwise. Thank you for doing so! As a token of appreciation, <u>your name will be eternalized in the official DjangoCon Europe 2021 [webpage](/sponsors/contributors/)</u> (upon your authorization); and, you will also receive a <u>free Django t-shirt</u>!
