This year, we will offer all PyCon Portugal attendees a ticket for the ** first PyCon Portugal at a symbolic price of just €10** (limited to 1 ticket per DjangoCon attendee). The first edition of the conference will take place September 24 (Saturday) in parallel with the [Sprints](/information/sprints/) at the University of Porto. More info soon at: [2022.pycon.pt](https://2022.pycon.pt/){:target="_blank"}.

We are still drawing up the best [t-shirts](/information/tshirts/) for you! In the meanwhile, you can already purchase them together with your ticket. They will be from organic materials and you will be able to select its specifications later on (size, design, color, etc.).

The following **ticket types** are available:

- **Virtual Only Ticket [Early Bird] (€65)** - If you wish to attend PyCon Portugal from the comfort of your place.
- **Student Ticket [Early Bird] (€165)** - If you are currently enrolled as a full-time student or if you are currently without regular income. This ticket does not cover our costs for the conference, but we’ll be able to provide it to you thanks to other people paying more for their ticket than the minimal price.
- **Individual Ticket [Early Bird] (€265)** - If you are paying your ticket from your personal money and are not being reimbursed by your employer.
- **Individual SUPPORTER Ticket [Early Bird] (€315)** - The additional money from this ticket type ensure we can afford offering cheaper tickets to students and other people who could not afford to join otherwise. Thank you for doing so! As a token of appreciation, your name will be eternalised in the official PyCon Portugal 2022 [supporters page](/sponsors/supporters/) (upon your authorization); and, you will also receive a <u>special gift</u> at the conference!
- **Business Ticket [Early Bird] (€365)** - If your employer is paying for the ticket or reimbursing you for your conference expenses.
- **Business SUPPORTER Ticket [Early Bird] (€465)** - The additional money from this ticket type ensure we can afford offering cheaper tickets to students and other people who could not afford to join otherwise.
