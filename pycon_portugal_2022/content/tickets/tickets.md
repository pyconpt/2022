If you are from a marginalised or under-represented group, and you are not able to afford a ticket, you should apply for a [grant](/information/grants/). **Please consider making an extra donation** to help us offer grants to people from marginalised or under-represented groups.

We are still drawing up the best [t-shirts](/information/tshirts/) for you! In the meanwhile, you can already purchase them together with your ticket. They will be from organic materials and you will be able to select its specifications later on (size, design, color, etc.).

The following **ticket types** are available:

- **Student Ticket (€45)** - If you are currently enrolled as a full-time student or if you are currently without regular income. This ticket does not cover our costs for the conference, but we’ll be able to provide it to you thanks to other people paying more for their ticket than the minimal price.
- **Individual Ticket (€55)** - If you are paying your ticket from your personal money and are not being reimbursed by your employer.
- **Business Ticket (€65)** - If your employer is paying for the ticket or reimbursing you for your conference expenses.
