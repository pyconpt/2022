title: who is attending?
layout: simple

This is a conference for software developers, DevOps, entrepreneurs, marketeers, sprouting new Djangonauts, recruiters and exciting partners working with Python and Django.

The attendees is a mixed crowd with various professional positions and levels. Approximately half are newcomers.

We have room for an unlimited number of attendees. The physical events usually have an attendance of 400 persons. Nevertheless, last year's editon, the first-ever in a virtual format, had **more than 800 registrations!** DjangoCons exist world-wide and the community and audience are from all continents (except perhaps Antarctica?).
