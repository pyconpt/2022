This 13th edition of PyCon Europe and it will be taking place online and will be accessible worldwide.

PyCon Europe is a conference run **by** the Django community **for** the Django community and we believe this is the best conference for partners and sponsors to connect **with** the Django community and to be part of it.

PyCon Europe has existed for more than a decade and is therefore very professionally run, 100% by passionate volunteers and on a not-for-profit basis.
