Childcare at PyCon Europe and tech conferences more generally is an important factor that helps folks attend who otherwise may not be able to. We want to make sure that parents feel welcome bringing their children to PyCon Europe and that the availability of childcare is not a barrier to attending.

If you are interested in childcare free of charge please **fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/MzJN93m5yTWKk2L48){:target="_blank"} by April 30**.

We look forward to seeing you -- and your kids -- soon in Porto!
