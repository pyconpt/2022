The easiest way to travel is with the Andante Tour tickets, 1 day – 7.00€ and 3 days – 15.00€ (both available at the Trindade metro station and the S. Bento train station ticket offices). This ticket allows you unlimited travel on both bus and metro.

### metro

Running daily between 06:00 - 01:00, the Porto metro service has 6 lines that connect the outskirts of the city to the centre. The Andante occasional ticket, from Z2 to Z12, depending on the number of zones included in your journey, can also be purchased from the automatic ticket machines in the metro stations.

### bus

Buses operate daytime services (from 05:00 until 00:30 with some lines only running until 21:00) and night services (from 00:00 until 05:00 - lines 1M to 13M). Bus tickets (to be validated upon entering the bus) can be purchased from Payshop offices, train station ticket offices, post offices, Andante shops, automatic ticket machines and at the STCP or Andante service points. It is also possible to get a Single Trip Ticket (Título Agente Único) in the bus (bought for that trip only) - 2.00€.

### taxis and ride-sharing

Taxis in Porto are usually not very expensive, however ride-sharing apps such as [Uber](https://www.uber.com), [Bolt](https://bolt.eu) and [Kapten](https://www.kapten.com/) are also available.
