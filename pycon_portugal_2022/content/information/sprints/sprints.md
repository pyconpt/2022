So you have listened to all the exciting topics on Python for three days and now feel motivated do something about it. What could be a better motivation than contributing to the very open source software you just listened to?

On Saturday and Sunday, you have the opportunity to do exactly that. This is your opportunity to contribute to Open Source software. Even if you haven't contributed before, this is also an option to take your first steps. In the sprint, you can contibute to Python as you see fit, and if you need help, there will a pool of experienced conributors to guide you. You con also reach out through slack in the <a href="https://pyconportugal.slack.com/" target="_blank">sprints channel</a>.
