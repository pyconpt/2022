Some attendees purchased a t-shirt, and others have a t-shirt included in their ticket (contributor) - for those please select the t-shirt specs you prefer in the form above. However, **if you didn't buy a t-shirt you can still grab one [here](https://a.beamian.com/#/event/tickets/djangocon-europe-2021){:target="_blank"}.**

We have **two designs available in three colors each**. But please note that the color of the t-shirts is approximate, and the final product might have a slightly different color.
