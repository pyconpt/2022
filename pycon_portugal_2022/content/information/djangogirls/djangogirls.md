**Django Girls is a free one-day programming workshop** for women and other people who are underrepresented in tech because of their gender identity. It's a mentored workshop. Attendees follow the Django Girls tutorial and mentors help then by answering their questions and guiding them if they are stuck. It's a friendly environment for women to get into programming.

It will take place on **June 5th 2021 (Saturday) fully online**, as a part of DjangoCon Europe 2021. We believe the IT industry will greatly benefit from bringing more women into technology. We want to give you an opportunity to learn how to program and become one of us â€“ women programmers. Don't wait too long, and apply now!
