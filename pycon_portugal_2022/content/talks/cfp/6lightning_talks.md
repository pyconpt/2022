title: lightning <br/> talks 🌩️
layout: simple

Not up for a full talk or tutorial? Looking to give your first talk at a conference? Lightning talks are talks of 5 minutes or less, with or without slides, on almost any topic you want! Even if you’re nervous or shy, remember: it’s a MAXIMUM of 5 minutes. Every day of the conference will feature a lightning talk slot at the end of the day. Sign-ups will happen **during the conference**.
