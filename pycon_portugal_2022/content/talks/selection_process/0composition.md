First off, a warning: all of the following numbers are approximate and may change – we don't know the future, and we may have to adjust to changed circumstances in a number of ways.

PyCon Portugal has three conference days reserved for talks (followed by two days of sprints with tutorials on the side). Past experience shows that more than 10 talks per day (plus room for lightning talks) is a bit much, so we're looking at about 27 talk slots we can distribute among submissions. Of these 27:

* 3 will go to **keynote** speakers selected by us. We're very much open to suggestions, so contact us if there is anybody you'd like to see or hear as a keynote speaker!

* 4 **project presentations**. These talks show ways and areas in which Python may be used.

* 3 **community talks**. These are meant to show the struggles we face as a community, and as individuals. They can include talks on personal growth, or demonstrate problems that are still waiting to be resolved.

* 15 talks about **Python and working with Python**:

    - 6 talks **accessible to beginners**, focussing on concepts, introductions, guides, and other material most useful to those new to Python, having used Python for about a year or less. Includes common workflows (like debugging and testing) and introductions to tools integrated with Python.

    - 6 more **advanced talks**, explaining concepts or implementation details in depth, for people who have used Python for more than a year. Includes uncommon workflows, and improvements on testing and debugging workflows.
    
    - 3 talks at a **very advanced level** on implementation details and planned features. We also hope to offer a bit of the Python Under The Hood spirit here.

* 2 talks focusing on languages or frameworks that are **not Python**.

If your talk idea does not match any of these categories, or matches more than one – don't worry! This is not a strict list that every submission needs to fit in, it is just meant as a guide for attendees, submitters, and reviewers alike.
